# String ðŸš€

### Concepts
1. String Pool
   - object of string will be stored in pool.
2. Immutability
   - If you want to make changes in in existing string.. it will not do that.. instead it will create a new object of that string
   - Why String objects are immutable in Java?ðŸ’¡
     
As Java uses the concept of String literal. Suppose there are 5 reference variables, all refer to one object "Sachin". If one reference variable changes the value of the object, it will be affected by all the reference variables. That is why String objects are immutable in Java.
  
### to deal with this java has stringbuilder class
- StringBhilder in mutable.


## Serialization in java:

- saving state of object in to the file
- process of converting an object (stored in heap memory) form java supproted form to network or file supproted form.

## Deserialization in java:

- reading state of object from the file
- process of converting an object (stored in heap memory) form network or file supproted form to java supproted form.

##### code:

```
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
import java.io.ObjectOutputStream;
import java.io.Serializable;

class Dog implements Serializable{
    int i = 10;
    int j= 20;
}
public class SerializationDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args)throws Exception{
    Dog d1 = new Dog();
// Serialization
    FileOutputStream fs = new FileOutputStream("demo.txt");
    ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(fs);
    oos.writeObject(d1);

    // DeSerializationDemo
    FileInputStream fi = new FileInputStream("demo.txt");
    ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(fi);
    Dog d2 = (Dog)ois.readObject();
    System.out.println(d2.i+d2.j);
    }
}

```

- Serializable Interface comes under java.io
- it dont contains any method (required ability can be provided by JVM).
- "if you want to serialize an object it should be serialize object and class should implement serializable object".


### String Literal
- object of string will be stored in string constant pool.

### new Keyword
- it will create object of string outside pool in heap memory.


# Functions/Methods ðŸš€
- Static int fun() - return - end of function
- Static void fun() - sout
